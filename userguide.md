### Creating a budget

Before adding your first expense, you must create a budget with defined expense categories. Each expense (e.g., dining out on Friday) must be assigned to a suitable expense category (e.g., Eating Out).

#### Expense categories
To add an expense category, click the 'View Budget' button on the main dashboard. From the budget view, select 'Add New +' in the top right to create a new category. Existing categories can be edited by clicking on their respective cards.

#### Expenses
Actual expenses can be logged once a category has been created. The expense can be logged from the main dashboard by clicking 'Log Expense' or from the budget view by clicking 'Add New +' under the expenses tab.

Existing expenses can be deleted by clicking 'Delete' in the expense row:

### Net worth tracking

Creating assets and liabilities enables you to track the growth of your net worth over time. You can log assets (e.g., your house, car, or investments) and liabilities (e.g., loans, credit cards, or other debts). Any unallocated monthly spending will be added to your net worth growth.

#### Creating an asset or liability
To create an asset, click 'Net Worth' on the main dashboard, then select 'Add New +' under the 'What I Have' tab. Similarly, to create a liability (debt), click 'Add New +' under the 'What I Owe' tab.

#### Editing assets and liabilities
Assets and liabilities can be edited by clicking on their respective cards. Updating the value will log a new entry, while the application retains a record of historical values to track profit or loss over time. You can also delete an asset/liability from the edit modal by clicking 'Delete asset'.
