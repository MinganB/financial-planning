### Creating a budget

Before adding your first expense, you must create a budget with defined expense categories. Each expense (e.g., dining out on Friday) must be assigned to a suitable expense category (e.g., Eating Out).

#### Expense categories
To add an expense category, click the 'View Budget' button on the main dashboard. From the budget view, select 'Add New +' in the top right to create a new category. Existing categories can be edited by clicking on their respective cards.
