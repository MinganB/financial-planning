### Creating a budget

Before adding your first expense, you must create a budget with defined expense categories. Each expense (e.g., dining out on Friday) must be assigned to a suitable expense category (e.g., Eating Out).

#### Expense categories
To add an expense category:  
1. Click the **View Budget** button on the main dashboard.  
2. From the budget view, select **Add New +** in the top right to create a new category.  
3. Existing categories can be edited by clicking on their respective cards.

#### Expenses
Once a category has been created, you can log actual expenses:  
- From the main dashboard, click **Log Expense**.  
- Alternatively, go to the budget view and click **Add New +** under the expenses tab.  
- To delete existing expenses, click **Delete** in the expense row.

### Net worth tracking

Creating assets and liabilities enables you to track the growth of your net worth over time. You can log assets (e.g., your house, car, or investments) and liabilities (e.g., loans, credit cards, or other debts). Any unallocated monthly spending will be added to your net worth growth.

#### Creating an asset or liability
- To create an asset, click **Net Worth** on the main dashboard, then select **Add New +** under the *What I Have* tab.  
- Similarly, to create a liability (debt), click **Add New +** under the *What I Owe* tab.

#### Editing assets and liabilities
- To edit an asset or liability, click on its respective card.  
- Updating the value will log a new entry, while the application retains a record of historical values to track profit or loss over time.  
- You can delete an asset or liability from the edit modal by clicking **Delete Asset**.

## Account and application settings
To manage your account and settings:  
1. Click **App Settings** on the main dashboard.  
2. From here, you can:  
   - Update your password.  
   - Adjust privacy and sharing settings.
